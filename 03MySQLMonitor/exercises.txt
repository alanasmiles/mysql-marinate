1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

The clients connect to the server where the database resides.  There are many types of clients including mysql command line monitor and GUI interfaces. 

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)


"
	mysql> help select
Name: 'SELECT'
Description:
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
      [HIGH_PRIORITY]
      [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
      [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
      [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr, ...
    [FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name' export_options
      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name']
    [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [union], and
[subqueries].

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [join].

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

While in interactive mode the monitor will execute a command after you type and display the results.  While using batch mode a list of commands will be read by the monitor and they will all be executed.  Batch mode is useful for running long lists of commands.


4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

User - This is the user name used to connect to the MySQL server and is passed as an option while connecting to the server.

Password - Is a security feature limiting access to the MySQL server.  A password can be passed as an option while connecting to the MySQL server.

Database - Is an optional parameter that can be passed to the MySQL server when connecting instructing the monitor to use the indicated database.
